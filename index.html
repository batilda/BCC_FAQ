                Hello, I’m frequently in travel and I was interested in applying for a card that
                allow me to collect cash back on my gas purchases. I haven’t been able to find
                any suitable cards. Are there any cards you could recommend to me?
              </div>
              <div class="faq-item__answer">
                Yes, there are. There are many credit cards available that will allow you to collect
                cash back on the gas purchases. You can choose between a card that will allow to collect
                between 1-2% cash back on purchases and some card to get the most out of your purchases.
                If you apply for a cash back credit card that comes with gas, you will be able to receive
                a lot of cash back on fuel purchases...
